I have a very ambitious list of technologies and programming languages I want to learn. Thanks to [Chris Jang](https://twitter.com/chrisj_fc) for suggesting the idea of writing blog posts to document things I learn. 

# github pages and jekyll

So all you have to do to host a website on github is create a repository called <username>.github.io, and then github does some magic and hosts it. 

I wanted to have a super simple blog type website so I did a quick google search and `jekyll` seemed to be the best took for the job. It's designed for blogs, it's static and it seems to be github integrated? But maybe everything is. But even more maybe it does some magic to turn these markdown files into some sort of html nonesense. 

In order to test your webpage locally type the following:

        bundle exec jekyll serve

# Mr Ruby man

I also learned about this guy today: [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto). He's the inventor of Ruby. I loved this quote from the wikipedia article:
>His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.
