# Node

NodeJS is a runtime environment for running javascript. I believe it was created to enable running javascript in non-browser environments. It focuses on concurrency and makes an effort to make everything a non-blocking call. Pretty interesting stuff. It tries to not do any IO operations itself, instead it attempts to offload all such operations to the system kernel.

`npm` is the package manager for Nodejs and Javascript in general. It stands for 'node package manager'.
