# Node

NodeJS is a runtime environment for running javascript. I believe it was created to enable running javascript in non-browser environments. But you can use it for running javascript on your local machine as well. It focuses on concurrency and makes an effort to make everything a non-blocking call. Pretty interesting stuff. It tries to not do any IO operations itself, instead it attempts to offload all such operations to the system kernel.

`npm` is the package manager for Nodejs and Javascript in general. It stands for 'node package manager'.  

# JavaScript

[V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) is the javascript engine created by google for running javascript in browsers. 

Typescript is just strongly typed javascript that is transpiled into javascript. It is developed by microsoft for creating larger more complex systems.

You can stick javascript in some html like this:

        <!DOCTYPE HTML>
        <html>

        <body>

        <p>Before the script...</p>

        <script>
            alert( 'Hello, world!' );
        </script>

        <p>...After the script.</p>

        </body>

        </html>
