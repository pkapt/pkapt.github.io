Today I was working on my command line [typing speed test](https://github.com/pkapt/wpm). Here are a couple of things I learned.

***
## Markdown 
`***` and '___' make a horizontal line that goes all the way across the screen.

## C
# Print colored text

Windows has some great APIs for manipulating console attributes like color and cursor coordinates.

    #include <windows.h>
    unsigned short color = <some color>;
    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, color);
    printf("text");

Colors are values between 0 to 255. Each number refers to a forground color and a background color. 

Here is small program to test out this functionality.

    #include <windows.h>

    int main() {
        for(unsigned short i = 0; i < 256; i++)
        {
            HANDLE hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
            SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, i);
            printf("number: %u\n", i);
        }
        return 0;
    }
